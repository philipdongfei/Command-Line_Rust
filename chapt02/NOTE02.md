# Test for Echo

## How echo Works

## Getting Started

The **unit type** is like an empty value and is signified with a set of empty parentheses: (). The documentation says this "is used when there is no other meaningful value that could be returned." It's not quite like a null pointer or undefined value in other languages, a concept first introduced by Tony Hoare (no relation to Rust creator Graydon Hoare), who called the null reference his "billion-dollar mistake." Since Rust does not (normally) allow you to dereference a null
pointer, it must logically be worth at least a billion dollars.
