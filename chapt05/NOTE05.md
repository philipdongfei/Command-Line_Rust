## Getting Started

> #### Iterator Methods That Take a Closure
> 
> You should take some time to read the **Iterator documentation** to note the other methods that take a closure as an argument to select, test, or transform the elements, including the following:
> 
> - **Iterator::any** will return true if even one evaluation of the closure for an item returns true.
> - **Iterator::filter** will find all elements for which the predicate is true.
> - **Iterator::map** will apply a closure to each element and return a **std::iter::Map** with the transformed elements.
> - **Iterator::find** will return the first element of an iterator that satisfies the predicate as Some(value) or None if all elements evaluate to false.
> - **Iterator::position** will return the index of the first element that satisfies the predicate as Some(value) or None if all elements evaluate to false.
> - **Iterator::cmp**, **Iterator::min_by**, and **Iterator::max_by** have predicates that accept pairs of items for comparison or to find the minimum and maximum.
