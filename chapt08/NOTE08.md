# Shave and a Haircut

## How cut Works

## Getting Started

### Defining the Arguments

### Parsing the Position List

### Extracting Characters or Bytes

### Parsing Delimited Text Files

example: cargo csvtutor
#### Closing thoughts
- The [API documentation for the csv crate](https://docs.rs/csv/latest/csv/index.html) documents all facets of the library, and is itself littered with even more examples.
- The [csv-index crate](https://docs.rs/csv-index) provides data structures that can index CSV data that are amenable to writing to disk. (This library is still a work in progress.)
- The [xsv command line tool](https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv) is a high performance CSV swiss army knife. It can slice, select, search, sort, join, concatenate, index, format and compute statistics on arbitrary CSV data. Give it a try!
