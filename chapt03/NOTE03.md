## Getting Started

### Starting with Tests

So far in this book, I've shown you how to write tests after writing the programs to get you used to the idea of testing and to practice the basics of the Rust language. Starting with this chapter, I want you to think about the tests before you start writing the program. Tests force you to consider the program's requirements and how you will verify that the program works as expected. Ultimately, I want to draw your attention to *test-driven development* (TDD) as described in a
book by that title written by Kent Beck. TDD  advises we write the tests *before* writing the code, as shown in Figure 3-1. Technically, TDD involves writing tests as you add each feature, and I will demonstrate this technique in later chapters. Because I've written all the tests for the program, you might consider this more like *test-first development*. Regardless of how and when the tests are written, the point is to emphasize testing at the beginning of the process.
Once your program passes the tests, you can  use the tests to improve and refactor your code, perhaps by reducing the lines of code or by finding a faster implementation.
