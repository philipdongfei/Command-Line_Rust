# Head Aches

## How head Works

## Getting Started

The primitive **usize** is the pointer\-sized unsigned integer type, and its size varies from 4 bytes on a 32-bit operating system to 8 bytes on a 64-bit system. Rust also has an **isize** type, which is a pointer-sized *signed* integer, which you would need to represent negative numbers as the GNU version does. Since you only want to store positive numbers Ã  la the BSD version, you can stick with an unsigned type. Note that Rust also has the types u32/i32 (unsigned/signed 32-bit integer)
and u64/i64(unsigned/signed 64-bit integer) if you want finer control over how large these values can be.
